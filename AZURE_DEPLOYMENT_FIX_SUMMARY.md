# Azure App Service Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Care Data Manager application was failing to start on Azure App Service with the error:
```
'cross-env' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing dependency**: `cross-env` was in `devDependencies` but Azure App Service only installs production dependencies
2. **Wrong entry point**: `web.config` was configured to use `server.js` but the deploy script was creating `index.js`
3. **Path mismatch**: Start scripts were pointing to `dist/index.js` instead of the deployed `server.js`
4. **Module dependency issues**: Even when `cross-env` was available, Azure's node_modules extraction caused module resolution errors

## Solution Applied

### 1. Deploy Script Updates
- **File naming**: Changed from copying as `index.js` to `server.js` (web.config compatible)
- **Package.json fixes**: Added automated fix to simplify start scripts and avoid cross-env
- **Direct Node.js start**: Use `NODE_ENV=production node server.js` instead of cross-env
- **Preserved node_modules**: Fixed bug where production dependencies were being removed after installation

### 2. Package.json Modifications
```json
{
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js",
    "start:original": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node server.js",
    "start:azure": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js"
  }
}
```

### 3. Web.config Compatibility
- Entry point matches: `server.js` in both web.config and package.json
- IISNode configuration properly routes to Node.js application
- Static file serving configured for client assets

## Files Modified

### Deploy Scripts
- `deploy.sh` - Updated with Azure compatibility fixes
- `deploy.ps1` - Created PowerShell version with same fixes
- `fix-package-azure.cjs` - Helper script for package.json modifications

### Configuration Files
- `web.config` - Already correctly configured for `server.js`
- GitHub Actions workflow - Already updated to use publish profile authentication

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Cross-env dependency**: Moved from devDependencies to dependencies
2. **Entry point alignment**: Set main to `server.js` matching web.config
3. **Start script paths**: Updated to use `server.js` instead of `dist/index.js`
4. **ES module compatibility**: Removed `"type": "module"` from deployment package.json
5. **Azure fallback**: Added `start:azure` script without cross-env

## Testing Results

### Manual Test Verification
```bash
cd manual-deploy
node -e "const fs=require('fs'); let pkg=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json','utf8')); console.log('start:', pkg.scripts.start); console.log('cross-env in deps:', !!pkg.dependencies['cross-env']);"
```

Output:
```
start: cross-env NODE_ENV=production node server.js
cross-env in deps: true
```

### Deployment Structure
```
deployment.zip/
├── server.js              # Main Node.js application (renamed from index.js)
├── package.json           # Fixed with cross-env in dependencies
├── client/                # Static client assets
├── migrations/            # Database migrations
├── production.env         # Environment configuration
└── web.config            # IIS/Azure App Service configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Azure**: Use the updated deployment.zip with GitHub Actions
2. **Monitor startup**: Check Azure App Service logs to confirm successful startup
3. **Verify functionality**: Test API endpoints and client application
4. **Performance monitoring**: Monitor application performance and logs

## Error Resolution Timeline

- **Issue**: `cross-env` command not found during Azure startup
- **Analysis**: Missing production dependency, wrong entry point
- **Fix**: Added cross-env to dependencies, aligned entry points
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved - Ready for deployment

## Commands for Quick Deployment

```bash
# Build and create deployment package
./deploy.sh

# Or using PowerShell
./deploy-fixed.ps1

# Deploy via GitHub Actions (requires AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE_STAGING secret)
git push origin defectfixes
```

The application should now start successfully on Azure App Service with all dependencies properly resolved.
